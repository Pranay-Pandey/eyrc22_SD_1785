we hovered the world in circumcircular direction to find out the approximate position of boxes
whenever we say one, the drone hovered to reach at its center, and caputured a screenshot of that moment.
After the completion of traversing, we applied SIFT feature matching technique to get top 40 matching features
For each feature we used their coordinate and the geolocation of the corresponding matched feature to georefernce the image.
We first changed the CRS of task2d.tif to EPSG:4326 and then using pixel2coord to change our image coordinates, then used GDAL to the tif file. It was again changed to EPSG:4326 CRS format.
We then took the center coordinate of the refernced image to Publish to geolocation RosTopic and also to a cse file
In QGIS, when we tried to subscribe to the rostopic for coordinates, it hanged, so we used csv file to get its coordinate
Those coordinates from csv file were then Plotted.
