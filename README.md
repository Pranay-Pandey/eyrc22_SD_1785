# e-Yantra Sentinel Drone

e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition launched in the month of August every year for undergraduate students in science and engineering colleges, polytechnic. Selected teams are given a robotic kit complete with accessories and video tutorials to help them learn basic concepts in embedded systems and microcontroller programming. Abstracts of real world problems assigned as "themes" are then implemented by the teams using the robotic kits.

Sentinel Drone refers to a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is specifically designed for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. These are often equipped with advanced sensors, cameras, and other equipment that allow them to gather intelligence and monitor a particular area or location.

In this theme, we were able to learn to manipulate nano drones wirelessly, leverage them for automating surveillance tasks, using image processing and uploading data to GIS (Geographic Information Systems) systems. We were be exposed to tools such as the Robot Operating System (ROS), Drone Gazebo, OpenCV, Geographic Information System (GIS).

This competition conducted as a series of tasks, and our final problem statement is for the drone to deliver various packages to their destinations, optimizing for time and quantity.

## Task 0

The aim of this task is to get you started with installation of required software components like ROS Noetic and Gazebo.

## Task 1

The aim of this task is to build a PID control system to stabilise the quadcopter at any given position in a simulation environment in Gazebo and generating a georeferenced image using Georeferencer tool in QGIS.

## Task 2

This task was divided into 4 parts:

- Writing a wrapper over the existing PID control system, written in Task 1 to fly the quadcopter through a list of set points in the simulation environment in Gazebo.
- Detecting object from the given image and find its pixel co-ordinates.
- Scaning the entire city area(arena) using drone, detect object from the drone camera.
- Now to geolocate (latitude and longitude) those suspicious object on the map.
