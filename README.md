# e-Yantra Sentinel Drone

e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition launched in the month of August every year for undergraduate students in science and engineering colleges, polytechnic. Selected teams are given a robotic kit complete with accessories and video tutorials to help them learn basic concepts in embedded systems and microcontroller programming. Abstracts of real world problems assigned as "themes" are then implemented by the teams using the robotic kits.

Hosted by IIT Bombay and sponsored by Ministry of Education of India

Sentinel Drone refers to a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is specifically designed for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. These are often equipped with advanced sensors, cameras, and other equipment that allow them to gather intelligence and monitor a particular area or location.

In this theme, we were able to learn to manipulate nano drones wirelessly, leverage them for automating surveillance tasks, using image processing and uploading data to GIS (Geographic Information Systems) systems. We were be exposed to tools such as the Robot Operating System (ROS), Drone Gazebo, OpenCV, Geographic Information System (GIS).

This competition conducted as a series of tasks, and our final problem statement is for the drone to deliver various packages to their destinations, optimizing for time and quantity.

## Task 0

The aim of this task is to get you started with installation of required software components like ROS Noetic and Gazebo.
